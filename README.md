# State of React Native survey

Hey everyone, Software Mansion here! ðŸ‘‹


Currently, we are preparing our first State of React Native survey but we need _your_ help! We'd like to ask for your opinion on what is important in the React Native ecosystem so that we don't miss anything crucial. We welcome you to take a look and participate in the discussion of this year's survey:

[Call For Question, State of React Native 2022](https://github.com/software-mansion/state-of-react-native/discussions/1)

The survey will be available at [stateofreactnative.com](https://stateofreactnative.com/) when ready. 

You can subscribe to [our newsletter](https://stateofreactnative.com/) to stay up to date.
